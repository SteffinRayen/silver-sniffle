Hearwith I have uploaded 3 games that I presented for my mini project during my Game Programming course. Will try to describe this stuff when I have more time to declutter my online presence :)

1. Simple Blender Game
2. Flappy with no script
3. Zombocalyse using Python :) [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6lwr6qWtz6SSVFIVkM2T3BLRzA/view?usp=sharing) -> Cause the file is too big to upload here :(
